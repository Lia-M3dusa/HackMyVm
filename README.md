## üöÄ About Me
Hi, I'm a programmer with some years with experience but in cibersecurity i'm a enthusiast, i'm not a expert cibersecurity with many years of experienc so this review would be with my current experienc, with the time i'll update this review.


## Review ü§ñ

First of all what is HackmyVm?
Okay many people who are in this world of cibersecurity knows about webs that help us to learn
cibersecurity, some examples are HackTheBox, Trytohackme, etc. 
HackmyVm is also same that the others webs what makes it different from the others is that to 
play with the machines we need to download the OVA of the machina that we want to resolve.

   others challegnes.

* The web had one server of discord where people help you with your problems by solving machines.


## Crons ‚≠ï

* Sometimes when you want to download one machine, the server goes slower and the download it takes 
  longer

* i'm my opinion i dont like that i close the window or when i didnt visited  the window the session\
  close, it's tedius login each time close the windows.

## Conclusion ‚ú®

test the web, but take in mind that some machines in this site are very brainstoms, so you to be rady so
suffer with some machines.

* This is my opinion and i hope you enjoy the web.
